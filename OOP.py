"""
the style of writing code

OOP is a programming concept of programming that advocates to software basing on real world objects
e.g windows operating system,apple
all objects come from a class
A class is a blueprint of an object and an object is an instance of a class
a blueprint is a master copy of an object e.g the original thing that you can duplicate is called
a class and the things we get out is an object
concepts in object oriented programming
 >Abstraction
 Is the level of representation e.g animal,(domestic animal,wild animal,)
 Abstraction is used to identify classes of that object
 >Inheritance
 In real world an object can take different things from different classes
 The ability to behave that way is refered to as inheritance
 Here we create subclasses from main class and when the main class is deleted the subclass is alo deleted 
 In inheritanc
 >polymophism
 An object can take two ore more forms e.g student can also be a daugter of the facilitator so we have class student,child.
 >Encapsulation
 Is the ability to restrict access to  some of the class or subclasses to the other .it can be an object that can be shared with an object 
 >overloading and overriding
 Note: class is written in singular e.g class country e.g uganda,Burundi
 class computer,laptops etc
 we identify a class by a phrase "is a"
 we dont use plural wen calling the name of the class e.g class phone but not class phones
