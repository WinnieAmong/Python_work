WHAT IS DEBUGGING?
refers to the process of finding  and fixing errors in your source code

WHAT IS A BUG?
A bug is a written code which doesnot give us the desired output
ais a glitch in software that prevents a program from achieving the desired output
a mistake that prevents the programmer from having the desired 
output/prevents the program from being executed properly

TYPES/CLASSIFICATIONOF BUGS
.syntax error(coding errors):errors that violates the syntax rules e.g 
spelling errrors,placing arguments where they are not needed
these occur during the build time,normally includes misuse of function,variables,parameters
these are normally underlined by the IDE(intergrated development environment)

.logical errors:these occur when steps taken to solve are not welldone./occur when the process of solving the task at hand
the programme works perfectly but it doesnt produce the expected results.

.Design bug: Is a an error introduced in the system during the design process causing the programme to do what it is programmed to do but not 

.Runtime errors/bugs:These occur when the application tries to perform an operation that is not allowed
and they are only discovered at the point of running the script or programme e.g when you divide any number by zero(0)
any calculation with a string

TESTING
refers to trying to test the limit of your code.


DEBUUGING CYCLE:
Step1;writing code
step2:check if it is working
step3:this is dependent to step2.if its not working ,you  debugging
step4:if its working then you are done then you go back to step1

BUG SEEKING CYCLE:
step1:writing the code/ coding
step2:trying to break the code(TESTING)
Step3:if you want to succeed in breaking it, then you need to DEBUG.
step4:if you fail to break it, then youre okay and go back to step1

PRINCIPLES OF DEBUGGING:
1.Catch your bug as early as possible.
bugs caught early are pretty easy to fix because the details are still in your mind and you know where to look
>catch your bug early
>only have one bug at a time .(est early and test often)
>look where you have been working or what you last changed if youre trying to find a bug
>always work in small chunks.avoid large chunks of code
(if youre using github always make small commits) 


2.if the bug isnt caught early  it gets harder  to find because the details are not in your mind and you have a larger search space


STEPS OF DEBUGGING
1.Plan your attack
2.Backup your files(using version control/using github to keep track of changes in the software)
3.Isolate the block of code that could have the error ie commenting it output
4.Finding the actual line/lines with the error or bugs
5.Fix the error don't patch it.
6.Test the fix you have just done
7.Look for similar buggs

OTHER STEPS AND STRATEGIES
>REPRODUCTIBILITY
   The first step is to be able to reproduce the bug
   understand the cause and effect before you change the code

>REDUCTION
  Finding the simplest test that exibits the bug ie reduce the search of the space bse bugs are not random
  they come from somewhere within the code

  >DEDUCTION
   Understanding what the programme is doing,since you cannot be able to know there is a bug if you dont know what the code is actually supposed to be doing.
  know every line of you code and understand what it is doing

>PAIR PROGRAMMING
  Someone else maybe able to see wrong assumptions or mistakes you may have made
   Helps you to explain and understand  what your are trying to achieve. code in beter detail as you will have to explain it to someone
   They suggest to you what you can do if you didnt see it

>LEVERAGING EXPERIENCE FROM OTHERS
  Seeking solutions from more experienced programmers

PREVENTIVE MEASURES TO AVOID BUGS
 1.Write clean and easy to read code ie indenting and not repeating yourself
  2.Commenting :helps you figure out which part of your code you would like to correct
  3.Make one change at a time
  4. Test your code:
        >The unit tests:
          Test functional blocks of your code
        >The intergration test
          Test interraction btn the functional blocks of your code
        >Test with invalid and valid data
          Tesing if your code runs with invalid data
   5.Defensive programming by adding error checking code and throwing exceptions(feedback)       
   6.Priortizing which features can be ommitted
   7.Incubating(sleeping )
   8.Brainstorming

   DEBUGGING TOOLS
  Breakpoints:
   These help you to see which part of the code is currying the bug.
   >printing out the contents of the variables


   research and use a debugging tool of choice
